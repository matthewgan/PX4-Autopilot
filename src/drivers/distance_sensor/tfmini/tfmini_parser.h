// Data Format for Benewake TFmini
// ===============================
// 9 bytes total per message:
// 1) 0x59
// 2) 0x59
// 3) Dist_L (low 8bit)
// 4) Dist_H (high 8bit)
// 5) Strength_L (low 8bit)
// 6) Strength_H (high 8bit)
// 7) Reserved bytes
// 8) Original signal quality degree
// 9) Checksum parity bit (low 8bit), Checksum = Byte1 + Byte2 +...+Byte8. This is only a low 8bit though
// Update data fromat for Benewake TF series Lidar
// Interface are unified for TFmini, TFmini S, TFmini Plus, TF luna
// 9-BYTE/cm default output format
// 5) Strength_L (low 8bit)		-> Amp_L (low 8bit)
// 6) Strength_H (high 8bit)		-> Amp_H (High 8bit)
// 7) Reserved bytes 			-> Temp_L (low 8bit)
// 8) Original signal quality degree 	-> Temp_H (High 8bit)
// Amp: Signal strength indicator. Dist value is unreliable when Amp < 100 or Amp = 65535 (Overexposure)
// Temp: Celsius temperature = Temp / 8 - 256â„ƒ
